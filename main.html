        <p>Do you want to sell with us? <br>

            If you grow it or make it using local ingredients we may have a place for you.
            
            We value conventional and organic production methods. Your sales staff must be involved in the business and be able to talk with knowledge about the products they are selling.
            
            We can offer marketing advice and suggestions.
            
            If you have sold at farmers markets before and it didn't work out, give our markets a try, or come and visit our markets to see how we do things differently.
            
            We are keen to encourage participation at our markets by producers from all parts of the community. If you think you fit the bill, please get in touch and letâ€™s talk about it.
            
            We visit all farms and businesses before they sell at our markets. We expect to see receipts for local ingredients, seed and plant receipts and movement books for livestock. See our rules to check that you meet our standards.
